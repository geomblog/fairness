There are, however, negative social perceptions about data mining, among which potential privacy invasion and potential discrimination. The latter consists of unfairly treating people on the basis of their belonging to a specific group. Automated data collection and data mining techniques such as classification rule mining have paved the way to making automated decisions, like loan granting/denial, insurance premium computation, etc. If the training data sets are biased in what regards discriminatory (sensitive) attributes like gender, race, religion, etc., discriminatory decisions may ensue. For this reason, antidiscrimination techniques including discrimination discovery and prevention have been introduced in data mining. Discrimination can be either direct or indirect. Direct discrimination occurs when decisions are made based on sensitive attributes. Indirect discrimination occurs when decisions are made based on nonsensitive attributes which are strongly correlated with biased sensitive ones. In this paper, we tackle discrimination prevention in data mining and propose new techniques applicable for direct or indirect discrimination prevention individually or both at the same time. We discuss how to clean training data sets and outsourced data sets in such a way that direct and/or indirect discriminatory decision rules are converted to legitimate (nondiscriminatory) classification rules. We also propose new metrics to evaluate the utility of the proposed approaches and we compare these approaches. The experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed techniques are effective at removing direct and/or indirect discrimination biases in the original data set while preserving data quality.},

Data mining comes with unprecedented opportunities and risks: a deeper understanding of human behavior and how our society works is darkened by a greater chance of privacy intrusion and unfair discrimination based on the extracted patterns and profiles. Although methods independently addressing privacy or discrimination in data mining have been proposed in the literature, in this context we argue that privacy and discrimination risks should be tackled together, and we present a methodology for doing so while publishing frequent pattern mining results. We describe a combined pattern sanitization framework that yields both privacy and discrimination-protected patterns, while introducing reasonable (controlled) pattern distortion.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.6805},
	abstract = {Data mining is an increasingly important technology for extracting useful knowledge hidden in large collections of data. There are, however, negative social perceptions about data mining, among which potential privacy violation and potential discrimination. The former is an unintentional or deliberate disclosure of a user profile or activity data as part of the output of a data mining algorithm or as a result of data sharing. For this reason, privacy preserving data mining has been introduced to trade off the utility of the resulting data/models for protecting individual privacy. The latter consists of treating people unfairly on the basis of their belonging to a specific group. Automated data collection and data mining techniques such as classification have paved the way to making automated decisions, like loan granting/denial, insurance premium computation, etc. If the training datasets are biased in what regards discriminatory attributes like gender, race, religion, etc., discriminatory decisions may ensue. For this reason, anti-discrimination techniques including discrimination discovery and prevention have been introduced in data mining. Discrimination can be either direct or indirect. Direct discrimination occurs when decisions are made based on discriminatory attributes. Indirect discrimination occurs when decisions are made based on non-discriminatory attributes which are strongly correlated with biased discriminatory ones.
In the first part of this thesis, we tackle discrimination prevention in data mining and propose new techniques applicable for direct or indirect discrimination prevention individually or both at the same time. We discuss how to clean training datasets and outsourced datasets in such a way that direct and/or indirect discriminatory decision rules are converted to legitimate (non-discriminatory) classification rules. The experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed techniques are effective at removing direct and/or indirect discrimination biases in the original dataset while preserving data quality.
In the second part of this thesis, by presenting samples of privacy violation and potential discrimination in data mining, we argue that privacy and discrimination risks should be tackled together. We explore the relationship between privacy preserving data mining and discrimination prevention in data mining to design holistic approaches capable of addressing both threats simultaneously during the knowledge discovery process. As part of this effort, we have investigated for the first time the problem of discrimination and privacy aware frequent pattern discovery, i.e. the sanitization of the collection of patterns mined from a transaction database in such a way that neither privacy-violating nor discriminatory inferences can be inferred on the released patterns. Moreover, we investigate the problem of discrimination and privacy aware data publishing, i.e. transforming the data, instead of patterns, in order to simultaneously fulfill privacy preservation and discrimination prevention. In the above cases, it turns out that the impact of our transformation on the quality of data or patterns is the same or only slightly higher than the impact of achieving just privacy preservation.},

This problem becomes particularly acute in the Big Data era, when predictions are often made in the absence of strong theories for underlying causal mechanisms. We describe the dangers to democratic decision-making when  high-performance algorithms fail to provide an explicit account of causation. We then demonstrate how information theory allows us to degrade predictions so that they decorrelate from protected variables with minimal loss of accuracy. Enforcing total decorrelation is at best a near-term solution, however. The role of causal argument in ethical debate urges the development of new, interpretable machine-learning algorithms that reference causal mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Data mining is gaining societal momentum due to the ever increasing availability of large amounts of human data, easily collected by a variety of sensing technologies. We are therefore faced with unprecedented opportunities and risks: a deeper understanding of human behavior and how our society works is darkened by a greater chance of privacy intrusion and unfair discrimination based on the extracted patterns and profiles. Consider the case when a set of patterns extracted from the personal data of a population of individual persons is released for a subsequent use into a decision making process, such as, e.g., granting or denying credit. First, the set of patterns may reveal sensitive information about individual persons in the training population and, second, decision rules based on such patterns may lead to unfair discrimination, depending on what is represented in the training cases. Although methods independently addressing privacy or discrimination in data mining have been proposed in the literature, in this context we argue that privacy and discrimination risks should be tackled together, and we present a methodology for doing so while publishing frequent pattern mining results.We describe a set of pattern sanitization methods, one for each discrimination measure used in the legal literature, to achieve a fair publishing of frequent patterns in combination with two possible privacy transformations: one based on k-anonymity and one based on differential privacy. Our proposed pattern sanitization methods based on k-anonymity yield both privacy- and discrimination-protected patterns, while introducing reasonable (controlled) pattern distortion. Moreover, they obtain a better trade-off between protection and data quality than the sanitizationmethods based on differential privacy. Finally, the effectiveness of our proposals is assessed by extensive experiments.},
